## Contributors

I, Elise, am the only contributor to this project.

## Timing

This exercise was made during my educational training at BeCode to become a web developer. I worked on this project from the 4th of March till the 8th of March 2019. It was a one week project.

## What is it?

It's a digital representation of my current Curriculum Vitae or cv. It's based on my real cv on paper. The same colors, fonts and structure were used.

## Tools

I build the page with mainly CSS grids.

## Struggles

1. Making the grid mainly responsive

2. Getting to know the parent-child relationship in grids

3. Major alignment
